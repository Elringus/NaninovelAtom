## Installation

1. Install [`language-naniscript`](https://atom.io/packages/language-naniscript) package
2. Install [`atom-ide-ui`](https://atom.io/packages/atom-ide-ui) package (required to show the effect of the language server responses)

## Usage

Open a folder with `.nani` files; the extension should automatically activate providing syntax highlighting, error checking, auto-completion and command docs. 

Opening a single file won't active the extension, as Atom is only able to start language server in "project mode".
